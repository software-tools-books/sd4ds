title: "A Modest Synthetic Analysis"
---

We want to demonstrate how correlate variations in people's genes with variations in their phenotypes
(i.e., their physical characteristics).
To do this we need data describing individuals
whose physical differences correlate with differences in their genes.
We could subset real data from a source like the [UK Biobank][ukbb],
but (a) there are privacy concerns and intellectual property restrictions
and (b) that data is very complex.
Instead,
we will synthesize simple datasets that include specific variations.
FIXME: this is a way to check pipelines.
