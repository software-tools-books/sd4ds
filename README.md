# Software Design for Data Scientists

Most data scientists are self-taught programmers,
and feel overwhelmed when they transition from writing small scripts for their own use
to building packages and applications that other people can use to tackle larger problems.
How should you organize your functions and classes?
How can you make them easier to test?
And how can you make it possible for people to extend what you've created
without rewriting it?

The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples,
and the best examples to study are working models of things you use every day.
These lessons therefore show you how to build small but usable versions of
dataframes, testing frameworks, version controls systems, web servers, data pipelines, and other tools,
both to demystify them and to give you some insight into how experienced programmers think.
