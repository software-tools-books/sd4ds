# FAQ

-   **Is this done yet?**

    Nope.

-   **Why did you start this project?**

    Because other books about software design don't use
    the kinds of tools that most data scientists work with as examples.

-   **How did you write this?**

    Many of these examples were created to help colleagues at [Deep Genomics][dg]
    improve their skills;
    others are drawn from similar lessons written over the course of many years
    for researchers that I met through [the Carpentries][carpentries].

-   **Why Python?**

    Because most data scientists use either Python or R,
    and most other languages have more in common with Python than with R.

-   **Can I use this in my course, and if so, how?**
    1.  As [the license][license] says,
        you can use it in whole or in part,
        as-is or with modification,
        so as long as you acknowledge the source.
        However,
        the material assumes readers are already comfortable using dictionaries, classes, and exceptions.
    2.  Classroom lectures aren't the most effective way to teach this material.
        Instead,
        I recommend a studio approach:
        learners should work through some of the exercises (either on their own or in small groups)
        and then take part in a moderated discussion
        in which they compare and critique their solutions.
        Doing this also gives learners a chance to practice explaining their code and their thinking,
        which is as important as being able to write the code in the first place.
