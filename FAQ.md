# FAQ

-   **What is this book about?**

    Most data scientists feel overwhelmed when they go from writing small scripts for personal use
    to building larger packages and applications.
    The best way to learn design in any field is to study and work through examples,
    so this book teaches software design by showign readers
    how to build the tools they (should) use every day.

-   **Aren't there already lots of books about software design?**

    Yes,
    but most of them talk about it in the abstract
    or don't use the tools most data scientists work with as examples.

-   **Why not take apart real tools?**

    Because they are too complicated to be explained in a few pages,
    and because much of that complexity is repetitive.

-   **Where did this material come from?**

    Some of these examples were created to help colleagues at [Deep Genomics][dg]
    improve their skills.
    Others are drawn from lessons written for researchers I met through
    [the Carpentries][carpentries],
    or are translations of programs originally written for
    [*Software Design by Example in JavaScript*][sdxjs].

-   **Is it done yet?**

    Nope.

-   **Why Python?**

    Because most data scientists use either Python or R,
    and most other languages have more in common with Python than with R.

-   **Can I use this material in my class?**
    Yes:
    as [the license][license] says,
    you can use it in whole or in part,
    as-is or with modification,
    so as long as you acknowledge the source.

-   **How should I use it?**

    Classroom lectures aren't the most effective way to teach this material.
    Instead,
    I recommend a studio approach:
    learners should work through some of the exercises (either on their own or in small groups)
    and then take part in a moderated discussion
    in which they compare and critique their solutions.
    Doing this also gives learners a chance to practice explaining their code and their thinking,
    which is as important as being able to write the code in the first place.

-   **What do learners have to know before they start?**

    1.  How to move around the filesystem and create pipes in the Unix shell.
    1.  How to use dictionaries, classes, and exceptions in Python.
    1.  How to commit changes and merge branches in Git.

-   **Can I contribute?**
